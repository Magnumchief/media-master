[OPENING PSALM:\\
\\
Psalm 147: 1- 7 (NIV)\\
\\
How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him! The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel! He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name. Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit. The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground. Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp.\\

[CONFESSIONS\\
\\
The Word of God is alive in me, and I am alive to the Word, it propels me in the right direction every day and guides me perpetually in everything I do. I declare that the Word produces great and mighty results in my life and things are happening according to God’s purpose and will for my life. I am not ordinary; I refuse to accommodate ordinary results or outcomes in anything that concerns me.\\
In this month of Conquerors, I am enabled with the divine ability to speak for God, to speak for liberty, and to speak for freedom. I refuse to subject myself to intimidations of any kind, regardless of its source or whoever is behind it. I am conscious of the grace of God in my life with which I take charge as God’s outstretched arm to my world because greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.\\
The peace of the Spirit is at work in me, I refuse to be troubled about anything because I play by a different set of rules. There’s calmness in every area of my life and whatever turbulence seeks to trigger unnecessary agitations around me, and seeking attention are all silenced by the power of the Holy Spirit. I refuse to accommodate such distractions because I must do the work of him that sent me while it is day. I am in charge and everything is under control.\\
I am full of life, the life of God is at work in me, and therefore my body is in alignment with God’s Word every day. No abnormality is allowed in any area of my body because my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Sickness or disease can not share the same abode with the Holy Spirit. My health is perfect, my bones are perfect, my blood flows correctly and normally, my veins are perfect, my arteries are perfect, my cells are perfect, my lungs are full of life, my kidneys are working perfectly, my eyes are overtaken by the surge of the Spirit, and they are ever healthy and perfect, my joints are perfectly in shape, every part of me functions excellently, and there will never be any cause for alarm. My days are renewed like that of an eagle. Glory!\\
Money comes to me by free course, I refuse to struggle for money. I consciously put to work the financial principles of our kingdom for a great life and I see results in everything I do. I am loaded and super rich, I am far bigger than the systems of this world because the cattle upon a thousand hills belong to my heavenly Father, and I bask lavishly in my union and oneness with Christ.\\
Money is my slave, I dominate and rule over it, as an instrument, to the advantage of the gospel at all times. The sponsorship of the gospel will never be strained at my watch; I am diligently carrying out my ministry in this regard\\
without reproach. Glory to God.\\
I am excellent and I produce excellent results only, I refuse to be associated with half measures because God is perfect and the scripture says that as He is, so am I in this world. Therefore, I declare that I am perfect and I do excellent things. Glory to God.\\
